# plat

Example of using the `platform` key of a component to restrict which platform it
is built on.

As per the [recipe](recipe.toml) file, the `io_win` component will be built only
on Windows, from the [`source/io_win`](source/io_win/) directory. The `io_osx`
and `io_linux` components work exactly the same.
